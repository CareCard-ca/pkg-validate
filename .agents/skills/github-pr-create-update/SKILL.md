# Pull Request Create

## Purpose

Create, update, verify, push, and mark ready a GitHub pull request from the current repository branch into origin/development.

## When To Use

- Use when asked to create, update, push for, or mark ready a GitHub pull request from the current repository branch.

## When Not To Use

- Do not use for merging or deleting an already-approved pull request; use the merge cleanup skill.
- Do not use for ordinary local commits that do not involve GitHub PR work.

## Relevant Files And Directories

- Git branch state in this repository
- GitHub pull requests viewed with `gh`
- repository validation commands and `.husky` scripts

## Coding Principles

- Preserve the repository structure, naming style, module system, and local helper patterns.
- Prefer readable, maintainable code with meaningful function, variable, file, and test names.
- Avoid new dependencies unless the existing stack cannot reasonably solve the task and the user confirms the tradeoff.

## Testing Expectations

- Run repository validation before PR creation or merge when code behavior changed.
- Confirm the branch is clean except intended changes before finishing.

## Safety Constraints

- Do not edit generated output, dependency folders, logs, coverage, dist, or build artifacts unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Do not revert or overwrite user changes; stage only files related to the requested skill or instruction update.
- Never suppress errors, lint failures, type failures, security failures, or failing tests; fix the underlying issue or report the blocker.

## Scope

Use this skill from the root of the repository whose current branch contains
the intended PR changes. The repository must have `origin/development`, and
GitHub CLI must be available and authenticated.

Do not continue automatically when:

- The current branch is `development`, `main`, `master`, or detached.
- The working tree has uncommitted changes. Explain that a PR only includes
  committed changes and ask the user whether to commit or stash them.
- `gh auth status` fails.
- `origin/development` cannot be fetched.

## Workflow

1. Capture the source branch and run preflight checks:

    ```sh
    branch="$(git branch --show-current)"
    test -n "$branch"
    test "$branch" != "development"
    test "$branch" != "main"
    test "$branch" != "master"
    git status --short
    gh auth status
    ```

2. Pull a fresh development reference from the remote without leaving the
   source branch:

    ```sh
    git fetch origin development --prune
    ```

    Use `origin/development` as the source of truth. If a local `development`
    branch exists and is not checked out, it may be fast-forwarded to match the
    remote without forcing history:

    ```sh
    git fetch origin development:development
    ```

    If that local branch update fails because `development` has diverged or is
    checked out in another worktree, do not force it. Continue using
    `origin/development` for validation.

3. Check whether the current branch can merge with latest development without
   changing the worktree:

    ```sh
    if git merge-tree --write-tree HEAD origin/development >/tmp/pull-request-create-merge-tree.out
    then
      merge_conflict_detected=false
    else
      merge_conflict_detected=true
    fi
    ```

4. If a merge conflict is detected, try rebasing on latest development:

    ```sh
    if [ "$merge_conflict_detected" = true ]; then
      if git rebase origin/development; then
        git push --force-with-lease -u origin "$branch"
      else
        git rebase --abort
        echo "Rebase conflicted; aborted without pushing."
        exit 1
      fi
    else
      git push -u origin "$branch"
    fi
    ```

    Do not resolve rebase conflicts unless the user explicitly asks. If the
    rebase fails, abort it and stop.

5. Inspect the branch changes before writing the PR title:

    ```sh
    git log --reverse --format='%s' origin/development..HEAD
    git diff --stat origin/development...HEAD
    ```

    Create a concise, descriptive title from the actual changes. Remove words
    such as `draft`, `[draft]`, `Draft:`, and `WIP`. Do not leave a generic title
    such as "updates", "changes", or "draft PR".

6. Reuse an existing open PR for this branch when present:

    ```sh
    pr_number="$(gh pr list \
      --head "$branch" \
      --base development \
      --state open \
      --json number \
      --jq '.[0].number // empty')"
    ```

7. If there is no PR, create one against `development` and capture the new PR
   number:

    ```sh
    pr_url="$(gh pr create \
      --base development \
      --head "$branch" \
      --title "$title" \
      --body "$body")"
    pr_number="$(gh pr view "$pr_url" --json number --jq '.number')"
    ```

    Keep the body factual. Mention the main changes and validation commands
    that were actually run.

8. If a PR exists, mark it ready when it is a draft:

    ```sh
    is_draft="$(gh pr view "$pr_number" --json isDraft --jq '.isDraft')"
    if [ "$is_draft" = "true" ]; then
      gh pr ready "$pr_number"
    fi
    ```

9. Update the PR title after create/reuse so it is descriptive and contains no
   draft wording:

    ```sh
    gh pr edit "$pr_number" --title "$title"
    ```

10. Final response should include the PR URL, whether a rebase was performed,
    whether an existing PR was reused or marked ready, and any validation that
    could not be run.
