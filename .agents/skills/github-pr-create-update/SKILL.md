Non-negotiable root-cause solution rule: Always identify and solve the verified root cause, use the stronger solution, and deliver a correct, durable, production-quality result. Never treat a temporary workaround, resource increase, retry, suppression, bypass, or symptom-only patch as completion. Validate the root-cause fix against the real failing workflow and prove the end state.

# Pull Request Create

Non-negotiable TDD rule: Always write the failing test first, run it to confirm it fails for the intended reason, then implement the code and rerun the test until it passes. Test Driven Development is required for all coding work and must not be skipped. For documentation- or skill-only edits, add or update the relevant validation check before changing the prose.

Non-negotiable repository isolation rule: Every repository must run its Husky hooks and tests using only files, code, fixtures, dependencies, and services contained within that repository. Tests and Husky scripts must not import, require, read, execute, or otherwise depend on sibling repositories or paths outside the repository root. app-e2e-tests is the only exception because cross-repository end-to-end testing is its explicit responsibility.

Non-negotiable error and warning rule: Never suppress, silence, hide, downgrade, filter, ignore, skip, or bypass errors or warnings from code, tests, tools, compilers, linters, or validation. Fix the root cause, then rerun the affected check and require a clean result. Expected error-path tests may assert errors, but must not conceal unexpected failures.

Non-negotiable code organization rule: Functions with the same or equivalent behavior must use the same or clearly corresponding descriptive names across CareCard repositories, and equivalent functionality must live in files with the same names within each repository's established architecture. No backward compatibility names, aliases, or duplicate locations are allowed.

## Purpose

After the user explicitly asks for remote Git or GitHub PR work, create,
update, verify, push, and mark ready a GitHub pull request from the current
repository branch into `development`, or into `main` when `development` is
absent.

## When To Use

- Use only when the user explicitly asks to create, update, push for, or mark
  ready a GitHub pull request from the current repository branch.

## When Not To Use

- Do not use for merging or deleting an already-approved pull request; use the
  merge cleanup skill.
- Do not use for ordinary local commits that do not involve GitHub PR work.

## Remote Git Operations Guardrail

Do not run remote Git or GitHub operations unless the current user request
explicitly asks for them. This includes `git fetch`, `git pull`, `git push`,
`git push --delete`, remote branch cleanup, GitHub API calls, and any `gh pr`
command that creates, updates, readies, merges, closes, or cleans up a pull
request. Do not infer permission from branch names, validation needs, prior
workflow habits, or convenience; ask first when remote state would help but was
not requested.

## Scope

Use this skill from the root of the repository whose current branch contains
the intended PR changes. The repository must have `origin/development` or
`origin/main`, and GitHub CLI must be available and authenticated.

Default terms:

- Base branch: `development` when `origin/development` exists; otherwise
  `main` when `origin/main` exists.
- Source branch: the current branch unless the user names another branch.

Do not continue automatically when:

- The source branch is `development`, `main`, `master`, or detached.
- The working tree has uncommitted changes. Explain that a PR only includes
  committed changes and ask the user whether to commit or stash them.
- `gh auth status` fails.
- Neither `origin/development` nor `origin/main` exists.

## Workflow

1. Capture the source branch and run preflight checks:

    ```sh
    branch="$(git branch --show-current)"
    test -n "$branch"
    test "$branch" != "development"
    test "$branch" != "main"
    test "$branch" != "master"
    git status --short
    gh auth status
    ```

2. Select the pull request base branch. Prefer `development`; use `main` only
   when `origin/development` is absent:

    ```sh
    remote_base_refs="$(git ls-remote --heads origin development main)"
    remote_query_status=$?
    if [ "$remote_query_status" -ne 0 ]; then
      printf 'Unable to inspect origin base branches (exit %s).\n' "$remote_query_status" >&2
      exit "$remote_query_status"
    fi
    case "$remote_base_refs" in
      *"refs/heads/development") base="development" ;;
      *"refs/heads/main") base="main" ;;
      *)
        printf '%s\n' "No origin/development or origin/main branch exists." >&2
        exit 1
        ;;
    esac
    git fetch origin "$base" --prune
    ```

3. Check whether the current branch can merge with the latest base without
   changing the worktree:

    ```sh
    if git merge-tree --write-tree HEAD "origin/$base" >/tmp/pull-request-create-merge-tree.out
    then
      merge_conflict_detected=false
    else
      merge_conflict_detected=true
    fi
    ```

4. If a merge conflict is detected, try rebasing on the latest base:

    ```sh
    if [ "$merge_conflict_detected" = true ]; then
      if git rebase "origin/$base"; then
        git push --force-with-lease -u origin "$branch"
      else
        git rebase --abort
        echo "Rebase conflicted; aborted without pushing."
        exit 1
      fi
    else
      git push -u origin "$branch"
    fi
    ```

    Do not use `--no-verify`; pre-push hooks must run. Do not resolve rebase
    conflicts unless the user explicitly asks.

5. Verify the remote branch matches local `HEAD`:

    ```sh
    local_sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
    remote_sha="$(git ls-remote --heads origin "$branch" | awk '{print $1}')"
    test "$local_sha" = "$remote_sha"
    ```

6. Inspect the branch changes before writing the PR title:

    ```sh
    git log --reverse --format='%s' "origin/$base..HEAD"
    git diff --stat "origin/$base...HEAD"
    ```

7. Reuse an existing open PR for this exact branch/base pair when present:

    ```sh
    pr_number="$(gh pr list \
      --head "$branch" \
      --base "$base" \
      --state open \
      --json number \
      --jq '.[0].number // empty')"
    ```

8. If there is no PR, create one against the selected base and capture the new
   PR number:

    ```sh
    pr_url="$(gh pr create \
      --base "$base" \
      --head "$branch" \
      --title "$title" \
      --body "$body")"
    pr_number="$(gh pr view "$pr_url" --json number --jq '.number')"
    ```

9. If a PR exists, mark it ready when it is a draft, then keep the title
   descriptive:

    ```sh
    is_draft="$(gh pr view "$pr_number" --json isDraft --jq '.isDraft')"
    if [ "$is_draft" = "true" ]; then
      gh pr ready "$pr_number"
    fi
    gh pr edit "$pr_number" --title "$title"
    ```

10. Final response should include the PR URL, selected base branch, whether a
    rebase was performed, whether an existing PR was reused or marked ready,
    and any validation that could not be run.
